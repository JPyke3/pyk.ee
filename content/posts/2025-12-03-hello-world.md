Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll share thoughts on Linux, open source software, and web development.

## Why Start a Blog?

I've been meaning to document my journey as a developer for a while now. Whether it's debugging a tricky kernel issue, setting up a new development environment, or exploring a new programming language, there's always something worth sharing.

## What to Expect

Here's what you'll find in future posts:

- **Linux Tips**: From Arch installation guides to dotfile management
- **Open Source**: Contributing to projects and building tools
- **Web Development**: Frontend experiments and backend adventures
- **Hardware**: Tinkering with devices and custom builds

## A Quick Code Example

Since this is a dev blog, here's a classic to test the syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  return `Welcome to pyk.ee`;
}

greet('World');
```

And some shell commands because we love the terminal:

```bash
# Check system info
uname -a
neofetch

# Update the system
sudo pacman -Syu
```

## Stay Tuned

More posts coming soon. In the meantime, feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/JPyke3) or explore the rest of the site.
